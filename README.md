# Event-Study
The dataset includes company announcements such as Actual Earnings per share (EPS); Consensus EPS; Previous Year EPS; and Year on Year Revenue. 
The first fifty companies with 3 bad dimensions were selected. 
Conditions of a 3 bad dimensions (DDD) event: 
1.	Actual Earnings per Share (EPS) is less than Consensus EPS.
2.	Actual EPS is less than EPS year ago
3.	Year on year revenue is negative.

The result shows that a DDD event will have long lasting adverse impact on the stock performance of companies in the permanent category.
PS: ‘Permanent’ company’s AAR and CAAR falls after announcement and show no sign of rebounding to pre-announcement level by the end of the post- announcement window.
